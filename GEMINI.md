# Bowie Tracker Project Memories

- **Core Tech:** Rust/WASM web application using the **Leptos** framework.
- **Data Source:** Syncs listening data from **ListenBrainz**.
- **Storage:** Uses a local **IndexedDB** (via the `rexie` crate) as the source of truth for statistics and mappings.
- **Focus:** Specifically filters for and tracks metrics related to the artist **'David Bowie'**.
- **Data Normalization:**
    - **Concept:** Ported from the `interzic` crate (Alistral project).
    - **Mechanism:** Uses a local `mappings` object store in IndexedDB to link Messy IDs (MSIDs) to Canonical Metadata (MBIDs).
    - **Training:** The DB is "trained" (updated) with mapping data provided by the ListenBrainz API during every sync.
    - **Fallback:** A heuristic regex normalizer (`src/normalization.rs`) handles tracks without database mappings.
- **Dependencies:** 
    - `interzic` dependency was **removed** due to build failures on Windows/WASM (requires native SQLite/tuillez).
    - Logic was ported to `src/db.rs` and `src/normalization.rs`.
- **Current Status:** 
    - Application compiles successfully (`cargo check` passed).
    - `wasm-bindgen-futures` added to dependencies.
    - Build target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` required for final artifact.
- **UI/UX Design:** 
    - Theme: **Gruvbox Medium Dark**.
    - Design System: **Material Lite**.
